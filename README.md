## Notes

I definitely faced some challneges as I was trying to look for new optional features to implement. First I went through links and reources in your suggested (Improve the UI / UX of your app) link. Some links were not working. The other links, howver, cointained a lot of information that was not wasy to navigate. I tried to impelent some of ht UI designs that I found but finding actionable steps was preety challneging. Eventually, I decided to implement dark and light themes to my app using a switch. While I found many resources, they were not easy to understand and follow. Another challenge too was integrating the optional features with my existing code while maintaining the app's required functinality. After spending more time online with trial and error, I was finally able to add a switch that allows my app to switch between both the dark and light themes.

PS: In the first submission, I added the HelloWorld project which has only the required features. In the second submission, I added the HelloWorld1 project which has both the required and optional features along with two gif walkthroughs to demonstrate them.
